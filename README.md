# Amazon API

This project is a comprehensive edge API for Amazon. It supports search and product endpoints. The search endpoint allows you to search for products on Amazon. The product endpoint allows you to get product details by ASIN. This API supports both `REST` and `GraphQL` endpoints.

## Changelog 🔔

<details>
<summary><strong>1. May 5, 2024 - Amazon blocked Cloudflare ASN</strong></summary>

It seems like Amazon has blocked Cloudflare ASN. So, the API will work in development mode only. It uses hono, so it is possible to deploy the project on any other cloud provider.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. May 5, 2024 - Don't use the hosted API</strong></summary>

Please don't use the hosted API. Deploy your own instance of the project. The hosted API is for demonstration purposes only. The hosted API may be taken down at any time.

<summary><strong>3. May 5, 2024 - V2 is here</strong></summary>

I rewrite the full project from scratch. The new version is written in TypeScript and uses Cloudflare Workers. This version is faster and more reliable and also supports GraphQL.

Changes:

- Rewrite the full project in TypeScript
- Used Hono
- Add GraphQL support
- Add support for multiple country versions of Amazon

Cheers 🎉
